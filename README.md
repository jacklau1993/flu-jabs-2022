# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed flu vaccination data from 2022 to assess vaccination trends, compliance rates, and demographic patterns. Utilizing SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, I developed a comprehensive dashboard that provides actionable insights to support public health efforts in improving vaccination outreach and accessibility.

# Data Collection and Preparation
The analysis was conducted using datasets containing information on patient demographics and immunization records. Key steps in data preparation included:

- Data Extraction: Employed SQL queries to extract relevant data from the source databases.
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and corrected any inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure accuracy.

Tools Used: SQL for data extraction and cleaning.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
Utilizing Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard comprising several key components:

1. Vaccination by Age and Race:
   - Age Distribution: Visualized the number of flu jabs administered across different age groups to identify trends.
   - Race Distribution: Analyzed vaccination rates among various racial groups to uncover disparities.

2. Vaccination by County:
   - Geographical Distribution: Mapped vaccination percentages by county to identify areas with lower compliance rates.

3. Overall Compliance Rates:
   - Total Vaccinations: Calculated the total number of flu jabs administered in 2022.
   - Compliance Percentage: Determined the percentage of the target population that received the flu jab.

4. Running Sum of Vaccinations Over Time:
   - Temporal Trends: Illustrated the cumulative number of vaccinations over the course of 2022 to identify peak periods.

Interactive Features:
   - Filters: Enabled users to drill down into specific demographics, time periods, or geographical areas.
   - Hover Actions: Provided detailed information upon hovering over data points, enhancing the user experience and facilitating deeper insights.

# Key insights
- Demographic Trends: Identified age groups and racial demographics with lower vaccination rates, informing targeted outreach efforts.
- Geographical Disparities: Highlighted counties with lower compliance rates, suggesting areas for focused public health interventions.
- Temporal Patterns: Observed peak periods in vaccination administration, aiding in future campaign planning.

# Conclusion
This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, particularly in a public health context. The interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into flu vaccination trends and compliance rates, supporting data-driven strategies to enhance public health initiatives.
